# Introduction and overview
# What is a CICD pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps/processes that build, test, and deploy applications.It is a series of automated processes that enables software teams/developers to deliver code changes more frequently, safely and reliably. It coordinates the processes involved in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) into a cohesive process that streamlines and accelerates the software development lifecycle. <br/> It encompasses the entire journey of a code change—from development through testing and deployment—ensuring that code is properly integrated, tested, and delivered with minimal manual intervention. The pipeline automates key stages of software development to streamline releases, improve quality, and enable faster feedback loops. <br/>
Pipelines are fundamental to continuous integration and delivery/deployment (CI/CD). <br/>
### Key points
  * `Automation of Processes` : CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, streamlining software delivery. Each iteration can be refined based on lessons learned from previous ones. This leads to continuous improvement in the overall product. <br/>
  * `Reduction of Manual Errors` : They reduce the risk of manual errors and ensure consistent output quality. <br/>
  * `Rapid Iteration and Deployment` : CI/CD enables rapid iteration and continuous deployment of applications, supporting faster time-to-market. They allow teams to respond quickly to changes in requirements or user feedback thereby shortening the time it takes to get new features or bug fixes into production. Pipelines typically handle one iteration at a time, though stages within that pipeline can work in parallel.<br/>
  * `Multi-Stage Workflow` : A CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) that generally work sequentially, with each stage depending on the previous one. These stages focus on different aspects of the software development process (e.g., building, testing, deploying). In some cases, stages can also run in parallel, especially when testing multiple aspects of the software simultaneously.<br/>
  * The pipeline consists of `multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy)` that work in sequence or parallel on different iterations of the software. A CICD pipeline can handle multiple versions or branches of the software simultaneously, allowing teams to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel. The multiple stages of the pipeline can work simultaneously on different aspects of the current software version or update. <br/>
  * CICD pipelines are particularly well-suited & an excellent fit for iterative development. `Iterative development` is a software development methodology that emphasizes continuous improvement and flexibility. The term `iteration` in software development signifies a repeated cycle where a version of the software is refined and improved based on feedback, testing, and evolving/new requirements.  Instead of following a rigid, linear process, iterative development involves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable iterations or cycles that involves releasing software in small, frequent increments. Each iteration delivers a working product increment, and feedback from stakeholders is used to refine the next iteration. CI/CD pipelines support this by automating the integration, testing, and deployment of each iteration, ensuring that new features or improvements are quickly and reliably delivered.<br/>
  * CI/CD pipelines streamline and automate the `iterative development` process, enabling teams to efficiently deliver high-quality software with frequent releases, faster feedback, and minimal manual effort. Therei is `better alignment with business needs` as multiple iterations can cater to different business priorities or customer needs simultaneously. Team members can work on different iterations, maximizing  utilization. By having multiple iterations, bottlenecks in the development process are reduced. <br/>
# Definition of CI/CD and why CI/CD matters in modern software development
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment(CD), which are practices designed to automate different stages of the software development lifecycle.The CI portion of the pipeline includes source code management, building, and testing stages, while the CD portion covers the delivery and deployment stages. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to get new features into the hands of users. <br/><br/>
* `Continuous Integration (CI)` : It is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It ensures that code is continuously merged, tested, and validated, catching issues early and speeding up the development process. Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. This helps catch issues 
   early in the development process. <br/>
* `Key Elements of CI` <br/>
    * `Frequent Commits`: Developers frequently push/merge small, incremental changes to the version control system (e.g., Git). The idea is to minimize integration issues by integrating small chunks of code frequently.<br/>
   * `Automated Builds`: Every code change triggers an automatic build process, ensuring that the new code integrates well with the existing codebase. <br/>
   * `Automated Testing`: Automated tests (unit, integration, and sometimes functional tests) run with each commit, allowing developers to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle. <br/>
   * `Fast Feedback (feedback loop)`: CI tools provide immediate feedback, informing developers whether their code passed the build and tests or failed, enabling quick fixes.<br/><br/>
* `Continuous Delivery (CD)` : Continuous Delivery (CD) builds upon CI by automating the process of getting changes from version control to a production-like environment, ready for release. The key idea is that the software can be deployed to production at any time, but the actual deployment is still a manual process. The code changes are always in a deployable state and can be released to production at any time.Continuous Delivery is the practice of automating the release process so that code changes can be deployed to a production-like environment at any time. <br/>
* `Key Elements of Continuous Delivery` <br/>
  * `Automated deployments`: Applications are automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment.<br/>
  * `Automated Testing`: Continuous testing, including not just unit tests but integration and system-level tests, ensures that the code is production-ready.<br/>
  * `Automated Deployment to Staging`: Code is automatically deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production, ensuring that the application works as expected.<br/>
  * `Manual Production Releases`: While the pipeline prepares code for production, the final decision to deploy to production is still made by a human (often the release manager).<br/>
  * `Deployment pipelines`: CD pipelines define the steps involved in deploying an application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). <br/>
  * Benefits : Code is always in a deployable state, Reduces the risk of release failures, as every release is fully tested & Enables faster releases of new features, as developers can ship changes more frequently. <br/>
  * `Infrastructure as code`: The infrastructure needed for deployment is defined and managed using code, making it easier to replicate and scale.<br/>
* `Continuous Deployment (CD)` : This is an extension of CD (Continuous Delivery) where changes are automatically deployed to production without manual approval. It requires a high level of confidence in the automated testing process and a robust monitoring system. It's considered more aggressive than Continuous Delivery and requires careful consideration of risks and stability. It needs robust monitoring system. <br/>
* `Key Elements of Continuous Deployment` <br/>
  * `Automated End-to-End Pipelines`: Once a developer’s changes pass all automated tests and checks, they are automatically pushed to production.<br/>
  * `No Manual Approval`: Unlike Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment doesn’t require manual approval for production releases.<br/>
  * `Monitoring and Alerts`: Since changes are automatically deployed to production, monitoring and alerting become critical. If something goes wrong, the system must automatically detect and roll back changes.<br/>
# How CICD Pipelines work
A CI/CD pipeline typically consists of the following stages to automate various stages of software development, from code integration to delivery and deployment.: <br/>
 * Source Code Management (SCM) & Code Commit. <br/>
    * Developers write and commit code to a repository/hared version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). <br/>
    * Trigger: The pipeline starts when new code is committed to the repository. <br/>
 * `Continuous Integration Stage`<br/>
    * `Build`: Once a commit is detected, an automated build process begins. The pipeline pulls the latest code from the repository, compiles it along with dependencies, and packages the software into a deployable artifactsor docker containers (e.g., a JAR, WAR, or Docker image).<br/>
    * `Automated Tests`: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and sometimes static code analysis are run to ensure code correctness and compliance with quality standards & validate application's functionality. <br/>
    * `Feedback Loop`: If the code passes all tests, the pipeline continues. If any test fails, the pipeline is stopped, and results are looped back to developers ,with detailed feedback about the failure, for analysis and remediation. <br/>
