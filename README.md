# Introduction and overview
# What is a CICD pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps/processes that build, test, and deploy applications.It is a series of automated processes that enables software teams/developers to deliver code changes more frequently, safely and reliably. It coordinates the processes involved in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) into a cohesive process that streamlines and accelerates the software development lifecycle. <br/> It encompasses the entire journey of a code change—from development through testing and deployment—ensuring that code is properly integrated, tested, and delivered with minimal manual intervention. The pipeline automates key stages of software development to streamline releases, improve quality, and enable faster feedback loops. <br/>
Pipelines are fundamental to continuous integration and delivery/deployment (CI/CD). <br/>
### Key points
  * `Automation of Processes` : CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, streamlining software delivery. Each iteration can be refined based on lessons learned from previous ones. This leads to continuous improvement in the overall product. <br/>
  * `Reduction of Manual Errors` : They reduce the risk of manual errors and ensure consistent output quality. <br/>
  * `Rapid Iteration and Deployment` : CI/CD enables rapid iteration and continuous deployment of applications, supporting faster time-to-market. They allow teams to respond quickly to changes in requirements or user feedback thereby shortening the time it takes to get new features or bug fixes into production. Pipelines typically handle one iteration at a time, though stages within that pipeline can work in parallel.<br/>
  * `Multi-Stage Workflow` : A CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) that generally work sequentially, with each stage depending on the previous one. These stages focus on different aspects of the software development process (e.g., building, testing, deploying). In some cases, stages can also run in parallel, especially when testing multiple aspects of the software simultaneously.<br/>
  * The pipeline consists of `multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy)` that work in sequence or parallel on different iterations of the software. A CICD pipeline can handle multiple versions or branches of the software simultaneously, allowing teams to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel. The multiple stages of the pipeline can work simultaneously on different aspects of the current software version or update. <br/>
  * CICD pipelines are particularly well-suited & an excellent fit for iterative development. `Iterative development` is a software development methodology that emphasizes continuous improvement and flexibility. The term `iteration` in software development signifies a repeated cycle where a version of the software is refined and improved based on feedback, testing, and evolving/new requirements.  Instead of following a rigid, linear process, iterative development involves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable iterations or cycles that involves releasing software in small, frequent increments. Each iteration delivers a working product increment, and feedback from stakeholders is used to refine the next iteration. CI/CD pipelines support this by automating the integration, testing, and deployment of each iteration, ensuring that new features or improvements are quickly and reliably delivered.<br/>
  * CI/CD pipelines streamline and automate the `iterative development` process, enabling teams to efficiently deliver high-quality software with frequent releases, faster feedback, and minimal manual effort. Therei is `better alignment with business needs` as multiple iterations can cater to different business priorities or customer needs simultaneously. Team members can work on different iterations, maximizing  utilization. By having multiple iterations, bottlenecks in the development process are reduced. <br/>
# Definition of CI/CD and why CI/CD matters in modern software development
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment(CD), which are practices designed to automate different stages of the software development lifecycle.The CI portion of the pipeline includes source code management, building, and testing stages, while the CD portion covers the delivery and deployment stages. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to get new features into the hands of users. <br/><br/>
* `Continuous Integration (CI)` : It is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It ensures that code is continuously merged, tested, and validated, catching issues early and speeding up the development process. Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. This helps catch issues 
   early in the development process. <br/>
* `Key Elements of CI` <br/>
    * `Frequent Commits`: Developers frequently push/merge small, incremental changes to the version control system (e.g., Git). The idea is to minimize integration issues by integrating small chunks of code frequently.<br/>
   * `Automated Builds`: Every code change triggers an automatic build process, ensuring that the new code integrates well with the existing codebase. <br/>
   * `Automated Testing`: Automated tests (unit, integration, and sometimes functional tests) run with each commit, allowing developers to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle. <br/>
   * `Fast Feedback (feedback loop)`: CI tools provide immediate feedback, informing developers whether their code passed the build and tests or failed, enabling quick fixes.<br/>
