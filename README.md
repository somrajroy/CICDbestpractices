# Introduction and overview
# What is CI/CD?
# Why CI/CD matters in modern software development
CI/CD is a combination of practices aimed at automating and streamlining software development workflows, making it easier to deliver code changes more frequently, reliably, and efficiently. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment, which represent different stages of automation in the software development lifecycle. They are a set of practices that automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to get new features into the hands of users. <br/>
* `Continuous Integration (CI)` : It is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It ensures that code is continuously merged, tested, and  
   validated, catching issues early and speeding up the development process. Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. This helps catch issues 
   early in the development process. <br/>
* `Key Elements of CI`<br/>
    * `Frequent Commits`: Developers frequently push small, incremental changes to the version control system (e.g., Git). The idea is to minimize integration issues by integrating small chunks of code frequently.<br/>
   * `Automated Builds`: Every code change triggers an automatic build process, ensuring that the new code integrates well with the existing codebase. <br/>
   * `Automated Testing`: Automated tests (unit, integration, and sometimes functional tests) run with each commit, allowing developers to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle. <br/>
   * `Fast Feedback`: CI tools provide immediate feedback, informing developers whether their code passed the build and tests or failed, enabling quick fixes.<br/>
