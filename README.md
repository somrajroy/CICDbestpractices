# Introduction and overview
# What is a CICD pipeline?
A CI/CD pipeline is a series of automated steps/processes that build, test, and deploy applications. It enables software teams/developers to deliver code changes more frequently, safely and reliably. It coordinates the processes involved in continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery/deployment (CD) into a cohesive process that streamlines and accelerates the software development lifecycle. <br/> It encompasses the entire journey of a code change—from development through testing and deployment—ensuring that code is properly integrated, tested, and delivered with minimal manual intervention. The pipeline automates key stages of software development to streamline releases, improve quality, and enable faster feedback loops. <br/>
Pipelines are fundamental to continuous integration and delivery/deployment (CI/CD). <br/>
### Key points
  * `Automation of Processes` : CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, streamlining software delivery. Each iteration can be refined based on lessons learned from previous ones. This leads to continuous improvement in the overall product. <br/>
  * `Reduction of Manual Errors` : They reduce the risk of manual errors and ensure consistent output quality. <br/>
  * `Rapid Iteration and Deployment` : CI/CD enables rapid iteration and continuous deployment of applications, supporting faster time-to-market. They allow teams to respond quickly to changes in requirements or user feedback thereby shortening the time it takes to get new features or bug fixes into production. Pipelines typically handle one iteration at a time, though stages within that pipeline can work in parallel.Each stage in the pipeline (e.g., build, test, deploy) can process different versions of the software concurrently, improving efficiency and reducing bottlenecks.<br/>
  * `Multi-Stage Workflow` : A CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) that generally work sequentially, with each stage depending on the previous one. These stages focus on different aspects of the software development process (e.g., building, testing, deploying). In some cases, stages can also run in parallel, especially when testing multiple aspects of the software simultaneously. A CICD pipeline can handle multiple versions or branches of the software simultaneously, allowing teams to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel. The multiple stages of the pipeline can work simultaneously on different aspects of the current software version or update. <br/>
  * CICD pipelines are particularly well-suited & an excellent fit for iterative development. `Iterative development` is a software development methodology that emphasizes continuous improvement and flexibility. The term `iteration` in software development signifies a repeated cycle where a version of the software is refined and improved based on feedback, testing, and evolving/new requirements.  Instead of following a rigid, linear process, iterative development involves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable iterations or cycles that involves releasing software in small, frequent increments. <br/>
  * CI/CD pipelines streamline and automate the `iterative development` process, enabling teams to efficiently deliver high-quality software with frequent releases, faster feedback, and minimal manual effort. There is `better alignment with business needs` as multiple iterations can cater to different business priorities or customer needs simultaneously. Team members can work on different iterations, maximizing  utilization. By having multiple iterations, bottlenecks in the development process are reduced. <br/>
# Definition of CI/CD and why CI/CD matters in modern software development
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment(CD), which are practices designed to automate different stages of the software development lifecycle.The CI portion of the pipeline includes source code management, building, and testing stages, while the CD portion covers the delivery and deployment stages. The goal is to reduce the time it takes to get new features into the hands of users. <br/><br/>
* `Continuous Integration (CI)` : It is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It ensures that code is continuously merged, tested, and validated, catching issues early and speeding up the development process. Developers regularly merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. This helps catch issues 
   early in the development process. <br/>
* `Key Elements of CI` <br/>
    * `Frequent Commits`: Developers frequently push/merge small, incremental changes to the version control system (e.g., Git). The idea is to minimize integration issues by integrating small chunks of code frequently.<br/>
   * `Automated Builds`: Every code change triggers an automatic build process, ensuring that the new code integrates well with the existing codebase. <br/>
   * `Automated Testing`: Automated tests (unit, integration, and sometimes functional tests) run with each commit, allowing developers to catch bugs and errors early in the development cycle. <br/>
   * `Fast Feedback (feedback loop)`: CI tools provide immediate feedback, informing developers whether their code passed the build and tests or failed, enabling quick fixes.<br/>
   * `Benefits` : Early detection of bugs, Reduced integration challenges & Improved code collaboration and consistency. <br/>
* `Continuous Delivery (CD)` : Continuous Delivery (CD) builds upon CI by automating the process of getting changes from version control to a production-like environment, ready for release. The key idea is that the software can be deployed to production at any time, but the actual deployment is still a manual process. The code changes are always in a deployable state and can be released to production at any time.Continuous Delivery is the practice of automating the release process so that code changes can be deployed to a production-like environment at any time. <br/>
* `Key Elements of Continuous Delivery` <br/>
  * `Automated deployments`: Applications are automatically built, tested, and prepared for deployment.Code is automatically deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production, ensuring that the application works as expected. <br/>
  * `Automated Testing`: Continuous testing, including not just unit tests but integration and system-level tests, ensures that the code is production-ready.<br/>
  * `Manual Production Releases`: While the pipeline prepares code for production, the final decision to deploy to production is still made by a human (often the release manager).<br/>
  * `Deployment pipelines`: CD pipelines define the steps involved in deploying an application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). <br/>
  * `Benefits` : Automated, repeatable processes for deployment readiness, Code is always in a deployable state, Reduces the risk of release failures as every release is fully tested, Manual control for production releases & Enables faster releases of new features as developers can ship changes more frequently. <br/>
  * `Infrastructure as code`: The infrastructure needed for deployment is defined and managed using code, making it easier to replicate and scale.<br/>
* `Continuous Deployment (CD)` : This is an extension of CD (Continuous Delivery) where changes are automatically deployed to production without manual approval. It requires a high level of confidence in the automated testing process and a robust monitoring system. It's considered more aggressive than Continuous Delivery and requires careful consideration of risks and stability. It needs robust monitoring system. <br/>
* `Key Elements of Continuous Deployment` <br/>
  * `Automated End-to-End Pipelines`: Once a developer’s changes pass all automated tests and checks, they are automatically pushed to production.<br/>
  * `No Manual Approval`: Unlike Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment doesn’t require manual approval for production releases.<br/>
  * `Monitoring and Alerts`: Since changes are automatically deployed to production, monitoring and alerting become critical. If something goes wrong, the system must automatically detect and roll back changes.<br/>
  * `Benefits` : Immediate release of features and bug fixes, Complete automation of the deployment process & Faster feedback from real users.<br/>
# How CICD Pipelines works
A CI/CD pipeline typically consists of the following stages to automate various stages of software development, from code integration to delivery and deployment. Failure at any stage triggers notifications to the responsible developers, while successful deployments are notified to the entire team. The pipeline continues to run automatically, providing consistent feedback and enabling rapid iterations. In some advanced CI/CD setups, there might be overlap between these stages, or additional stages could be added. However, this general breakdown gives the overview of the typical flow. <br/>
 * `Source Code Management (SCM) & Code Commit.` <br/>
    * Developers write and commit code to a repository/hared version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). <br/>
    * Trigger: The pipeline starts when new code is committed to the repository. <br/>
 * `Continuous Integration (CI) Stage`<br/>
    * `Build`: Once a commit is detected, an automated build process begins by a CI server. The pipeline pulls the latest code from the repository, compiles it, and packages it into a build artifact. Focuses on transforming source code into a machine-readable format. A Build Server/tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) that pulls the latest code, compiles it, and prepares it for testing. <br/>
   * `Automated Tests`: Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests and sometimes static code analysis are run to ensure code correctness and compliance with quality standards & validate application's functionality. <br/>
    * `Package & Artifact Creation` : Focuses on bundling the built build artifact into a distributable format. Bundles the built artifact with necessary dependencies and configuration into a distributable format. This stage ensures that the artifact is in the correct format/state for the next stages of the pipeline. May involve creating archives, generating manifests, or integrating with specific deployment technologies. For containerized applications, this might involve creating a Docker image. For web applications, it might involve bundling assets and configuring the server. Output is a packaged artifact, such as a JAR, WAR, RPM, DEB, or Docker image, that can be deployed to different environments. <br/>
     * `Feedback Loop`: If the code passes all tests, the pipeline continues. If any test fails, the pipeline is stopped, and results are looped back to developers ,with detailed feedback about the failure, for analysis and remediation. <br/>
 * Continuous Delivery (CD) Stage <br/>
    * `Staging Deployment`: Code that passes all CI tests is automatically deployed to a staging environment (a production-like environment). Here, further automated or manual testing can be done, including user acceptance testing (UAT) and performance testing.<br/>
    * `Manual Approval (optional)`: For Continuous Delivery, a human may review the code and the pipeline output and then approve the final deployment to production. <br/>
  * `Continuous Deployment (CD) Stage` <br/>
    * `Automatic Production Deployment`: If Continuous Deployment is enabled, once the code passes all tests and validations, it is automatically pushed to production without requiring any manual intervention.<br/>
    * `Monitoring and Rollback`: After deployment, the pipeline may trigger automated monitoring and alerting systems to track the health of the live application. If an issue arises, the system may automatically roll back to a previous version. <br/>
# Understanding CI/CD Pipelines
  * `Difference between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)`
      * CI: Focuses on & involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day, triggering automated builds and tests to detect errors early.. Ensures a consistent and reliable codebase. The main goal(purpose) is to improve software quality and reduce the time taken to deliver updates by detecting and fixing bugs early in the development cycle. <br/>
      * `CD (Delivery)`: CD is an extension of CI that ensures code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. It involves deploying code changes to a staging environment where they undergo further testing, requiring manual approval for production. The goal (purpose) is to ensure that the code is always in a deployable state and can be released to production at any time with minimal manual intervention. <br/>
      * `CD (Deployment)`: Automates both testing and deployment, continuously releasing updates directly to production without manual intervention. The goal is to ensure that the software is always in a deployable state and can be released to production without any manual intervention. Often involves canary releases or feature flags to minimize risk. <br/>
      * `Scope`: CI focuses on integrating code changes and running tests, while CD (both Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment) includes the deployment of code changes to production.<br/>
      * `Automation`: CI involves automated builds and tests for each code commit, whereas CD involves automated deployments to production.<br/>
      * `Frequency`: CI happens multiple times a day with each code commit, while CD happens whenever a code change passes all tests and is ready for production. <br/>
      * In Continuous Delivery, the deployment to production is manual (usually to ensure checks or approvals), while in Continuous Deployment, the deployment to production is automatic after passing all tests.<br/>
  * `Common pipeline stages (Build,Package Test, Deploy)` : A typical CI/CD pipeline consists of several stages that help automate the build, test, and deployment of applications. Each stage is a step in the pipeline, ensuring that the software moves from development to production efficiently and reliably.<br/>
*`Build` : The build stage compiles the source code into build/binary artifacts (e.g., JAR files, WAR files). This stage ensures that the code can be successfully compiled and is ready for further testing.<br/>
             * `Build Tools`: Maven, Gradle, MSBuild. <br/>
* `Package`: The build artifact is prepared for deployment, often involving bundling with dependencies and configuration. The compiled code is packaged into distributable formats such as JAR, WAR, installation file or Docker images. This step prepares the application for deployment by making it ready for the environment it will run in (all necessary components are included & ready for deployment). Bundles assets and configures servers for web applications. <br/>
       * `Package tools` : Tools: Docker, JFrog Artifactory, Nexus. <br/>
* `Test`: Runs automated tests to validate the functionality, performance, quality and security of the code. This stage includes unit tests, integration tests, and other types of automated tests. The purpose of this stage is to verify that the application works correctly and meets the defined requirements before it is deployed. Continuous feedback from the tests helps ensure code quality and prevent defects from reaching production.<br/>
       *`Test Tools`: Tools: JUnit, Selenium, TestNG. <br/>
* `Deploy` : The artifact is deployed to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). This stage ensures that the code is correctly deployed and configured in the target environment. May involve rolling updates or setting up new infrastructure.<br/>
       *`Deploy Tools` : Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform. <br/>
* `Additional Stages (Optional)`.
      * `Monitor` : After deployment, the application is monitored for performance issues, errors, and user feedback (with performance metrics and logs being monitored to detect any issues).<br/>
      * `Rollback` : Some pipelines include rollback mechanisms to revert to a previous version if issues are found after deployment. <br/>
  * Tools used in CI/CD (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Azure DevOps, AWS DevOps)
